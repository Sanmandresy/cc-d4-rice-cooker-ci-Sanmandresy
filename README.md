# Rice Cooker

Here's the Lua version of the rice cooker.
I've followed the [Lua StyleGuide](https://github.com/luarocks/lua-style-guide) documentations for coding standards in Lua.

## How to use it ?

First you need to install lua on your machine.
If you're on Debian/Ubuntu just run:

```bash
    sudo apt install lua5.4
```

Then run the cli with:

```bash
    lua main.lua
```
