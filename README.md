# Rice Cooker

Here's the shell version of the rice cooker.
I've followed the [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/Home) documentations for shell standards.

## How to use it ?

First you need to install shellcheck which is the linter for shell.
If you're on Debian/Ubuntu just run:

```bash
    sudo apt install shellcheck
```

Then run the cli with:

```bash
    ./main.sh
```
