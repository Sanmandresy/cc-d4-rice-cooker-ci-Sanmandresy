# Rice Cooker

Here's the typescript version of the rice cooker.
I've followed the [Google Typescript StyleGuide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html) documentations for coding standards in typescript.

## How to use it ?

First you need to install bun on your machine.
If you're on Debian/Ubuntu just run:

```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Then run the cli with:

```bash
    bun run start
```
