# Rice Cooker

Here's the C version of the rice cooker.
I've followed the [C Style Guidelines](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/cstyleguide/) documentations for coding standards in C.

## How to use it ?

First you need to install cppcheck on your machine.
If you're on Debian/Ubuntu just run:

```bash
    sudo apt install cppcheck
```

Then run compile your code with:

```bash
    gcc main.c
```

Then run compile your code with:

```bash
    ./a.out
```
